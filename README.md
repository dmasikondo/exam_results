## About Exam Results Web App

This Web App is built using Laravel 11 Framework  with Breeze livewire stack, Alpine JS and Tailwind CSS as a semi auto system for enabling candidates to view their examination results after being approved manually on the system as having fully paid tuition fees


- The candidate registers into the system with the candidate number (of an external exam board) and national id number
- The system verifies the existence of candidate with the already entered results 
- The system sends notifications to the accountancy personnel that a new user has registered
- The accountancy personnel manually approves paid up status or declines after verifying with another system that has payment details
- A csv file of candidates with a fully paid up status can also be uploaded to the system
- Once cleared by the accountancy personnel or if appearing on the csv file of fully paid up, the candidate can now view own results
- Candidate can upload files and send messages to the accountancy personnel as proof of payment
- Candidate can send exam queries with file attachments to the examinations personnel
